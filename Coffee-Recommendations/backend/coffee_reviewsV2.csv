Although Ken (90) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) produced identical ratings, they read this coffee a bit differently, with Sean emphasizing its brightish citrus and floral tendencies while Ken added dark chocolate and hint of brandy.

Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (92) and Ken (88) split on this coffee and how to read its deep, ferment-toned fruit. Sean enjoyed the distinctive character of the fruit: “stone-fruited chocolate” with a hint of grapefruit. Ken read the same fruit but also picked up nagging musty/salty tendencies. Two parts milk smoothed things out a bit for Ken, developing a chocolaty sweetness, though Sean remained more committed here also, praising the shot’s “light, sweet, berries and cream” performance in milk.",Medium,May-11

Ken, at 92, liked this unusual sample better than co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) did, perhaps because Ken read more depth in the aromatics and flavor. Sean stopped at citrus, honey and caramel in aroma and small cup whereas Ken added dark chocolate and pungent fir. Ken also found a bit more going on in the finish, with flowers complicating a deep, bananaish chocolate. In two parts milk Ken and Sean read the cup about the same although applying slightly different language, with Sean citing lemon and ”light caramel” and Ken a “lemony chocolate.”",Medium,May-11

For Ken (91) berries plus a lot of other notes: brandy, malty dark chocolate, fresh-cut cedar. In the small cup Sean felt the aromatics turned crisper and drier: lemon, flowers, green bitters (as in asparagus); Ken read the same rounder, brandyish, cedary berries-and-chocolate notes as he had in the aroma.

Although both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) lavished a bundle of descriptors on this complex and challenging espresso, the real issue was how much to honor a pungent, musky character as it plays out in a well-pulled espresso. Both Ken and Sean were puzzled by the unusual aroma, but Sean, as he followed it into the cup, found it pleasing but just a bit edgy, perhaps musty, whereas Ken enthusiastically read it rich with the sort of pungent, earthy grapefruit character one finds in the best Sumatras.

The Kaanapali dry-process Moka is, as one panelist called it, a ""Yemen wannabe."" The trees that produced it are Yemen varietals, and the coffee has been processed in the simple, put-it-out-in-the-sun-to-dry approach used in Yemen and parts of Ethiopia. Which means that, like a Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia, it is fruity, winy, complex, with a disturbingly lush, overripe aftertaste that lovers of these coffees call gamy or wild and people who don't like Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia coffees call fermented.Five panelists labeled this coffee fermented and dismissed it with very low scores; three recognized the Yemen/Ethiopia characteristics and treated it like a middle-of-the-road dry-processed Yemen/Ethiopia coffee, giving it scores in the high seventies. Four didn't call it anything but gave it low scores.If this coffee had been presented to the panel in the context of similar dry-processed coffees from Yemen or Ethiopia I don't think it would have provoked quite the same level of criticism.

The reason: it clearly transcends the pleasantly mellow limits of the classic Kona profile. It displayed power, complexity, and an uncompromising, authoritative acidity, laid right on top of the usual soft, brightly sweet virtues of a typical Kona. Even the Kona-bashers on the panel liked this coffee. (Well, all but one.) Nobody raved, but there were lots of approving noises: ""excellent,"" ""very interesting, very clean on the palate,"" ""nice depth."" However, this excellent coffee might be too authoritative for those who like to slip into the softness of a more typical Kona. Lovers of Kona's sweeter, gentler side may prefer one of the less acidy profiles like the Guyer, Hamasaki, or Bayview Farms mill selections. The rather powerful acidity of this coffee casts doubt on the specialty coffee truism that only high growing altitudes (usually defined as over 4,000 feet) can produce solidly acidy coffees.

https://www.coffeereview.com/review/gumanch/,Gumanch,85,"Some winy notes flirt from inside the dark-roast pungency. Otherwise an unremarkable but solid dark-roast coffee: balanced, without sharpness, and nearly carbon-free.",Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/sumatra-mandheling/,Sumatra Mandheling,86,"A model Mandheling: Low-toned, heavy-bodied, balanced, mouth-filling. Some carbon, but buffered by depth and richness. Enough acidity makes it through the roast to keep the deep bottom of the coffee from sagging into boredom.",Medium-Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/aged-sumatra-mandh-pawani/,"Aged Sumatra Mandh., Pawani",90,"Spicy, perhaps smoky tones enliven the rich top notes of the aroma and carry into the cup. Surprisingly clear acidity, fine body, long finish, superb aftertaste.",Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/sulawesi/,Sulawesi,84,"Extends from a deep, rich bottom to acidy, wine-elevated notes at the top. The usual Starbucks carbon tones are pleasantly lost in the expansive complexity of the coffee until the aftertaste, when they surface after the rest of the profile has passed into memory.",Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/sumatra/,Sumatra,83,"This ingratiating dark roast comes straight at us, forgoing drama and intrigue. Not much Sumatra-style resonance behind its first sweet-pungent impression, but balanced and pleasing.",Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/san-juanillo-estate-french/,"San Juanillo Estate, French",81,"First pungent then complex, the aroma is full of intrigue. We get a bit less in the cup, but given the darkness of the roast what remains is still impressive: enough acidity to keep the body lively, and generally an admirable balance between the qualities of the coffee and the impact of the roast.",Very Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/sumatra-gayo-mountain/,Sumatra Gayo Mountain,80,"Dark fruit (prune?) tones complicate a solid, balanced, dark-roast character. Some carbon at the top of the profile, but good Indonesia richness underneath. The carbon dominates in the aftertaste.",Very Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/java/,Java,79,"Hard, high notes surprise in both aroma and cup, persisting into the aftertaste. But if you taste attentively the fundamental, Indonesian matrix of the coffee emerges beneath the sharpness: rich, subtly low-toned, balanced, with some tones that even could be called chocolate. In the first round of cupping the sharp notes seemed to energize the coffee; in the second they just tasted sharp.",Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/celebes-kalossi/,Celebes Kalossi,77,"Depending on whether your palate reads the fermented notes as pleasantly fruity or disagreeably cloying, you could love or loath this coffee. If you think you might love it, ignore the rating, which deducts for the ferment. Under the impact of the dark roast the ferment turns lush, almost spicy. Displays the usual Indonesia virtue of solid body.",Dark,Apr-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/ethiopia-yirgacheffe/,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,89,"Another flower-laced Yirgacheffe, shimmering with rose and lavender notes. Enough acidity to sustain the fruit and flower innuendoes, but rather light-bodied. Some carbon thinness seems to emerge as the coffee cools. Depending on whether you find the very pronounced flower tones a delight or a distraction, this coffee could merit anywhere from an 80 to a 100. I (roughly) split the difference.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/kenya-aa-4/,Kenya AA,90,"For a Kenya, displays a relatively restrained acidity. In another coffee this gentleness might be a fault, but here it reads as understatement, a polite permission for the complexity and echoing dimension of the coffee to emerge without getting upstaged by acidy dramatics.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/kenya-aa-6/,Kenya AA,93,"One more terrific, full-bore Kenya. The rich, winy acidity carries us up and out, expanding the boundaries of the profile and revealing the usual mouth-filling resonance at the heart of the coffee.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/ethiopia-yirgacheffe-2/,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,90,"Floral and vanilla tones hover in the high-toned acidity, exciting without distracting. The acidity is authoritative despite its floral delicacy and the body surprisingly substantial, although the entire profile loses momentum in the finish.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/kenya-aa-5/,Kenya AA,91,"The characteristically powerful, Burgundy-like Kenya acidity dominates, but if you're patient an immense and subtle richness opens beneath it, assuring a long finish and a resonant aftertaste.",Medium,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/kenya-aa-3/,Kenya AA,87,"The Kenya wine tones are lighter here, more Bordeaux than Burgundy. The profile is also simpler than in many Kenyas, but the high, singing tones of the acidity please until the aftertaste, when they turn slightly astringent.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/smaldeel-estate/,Smaldeel Estate,89,"The only Zimbabwe in the cupping. Lighter and drier than the best Kenya, with less dimension in the cup and a somewhat more attenuated finish. The pleasure is in the superb top of this coffee, both aroma and acidity levitating with dry fruit and cinnamon tones.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/kenya-aa-2/,Kenya AA,84,"Carbon tones overlay the sweet fruit fragrances of this dark-roasted Kenya, dampening but not obliterating them. A remarkable body and dimension open underneath the carbon, assuring a long, complex finish.",Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/breakfast-blend/,Breakfast Blend,90,"An exquisitely balanced traditional American-style coffee. The acidity is dry without astringency, alive with slight fruit or wine notes. Enveloped in the matrix of the body, it is always present but never dominant.",Medium,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/kenya-aa/,Kenya AA,81,"Some wine tones survive the dark roast to complicate the acidity. Brought along to a dark roast slowly enough to spare us burned notes, but for a Kenya not a lot of body or dimension either. The pleasure would seem to be the paradox of understated acidity and dark-roast pungency.",Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/seattles-best-blend/,Seattle’s Best Blend,88,"This coffee gets better as it goes, probably owing to its heavy body. The dark tones of the aroma modulate with increasing power through the cup to a complex finish.",Medium-Dark,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/ethiopia-longberry-harrar/,Ethiopia Longberry Harrar,81,"Impressive complexity for such a dark-roasted coffee. Prune and vanilla tones grace the aroma, while a fruit-nuanced acidity dominates in the cup. As the coffee cools suggestions of ferment surface in the fruity acidity.",Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/ethiopia-sidamo-2/,Ethiopia Sidamo,79,"The high-pitched fruit and vanilla tones in the aroma deepen to herbal wildness in the cup, then to hints of ferment in the finish. Sufficient body but not much dimension.",Medium-Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/ethiopia-sidamo/,Ethiopia Sidamo,74,"Pungent, chocolate notes enliven the aroma, but in the cup burned tones dominate. The body is decent, but in the aftertaste the carbon prevails completely.",Dark,Mar-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/bridgetown-blend/,Bridgetown Blend,77,"An intense coffee, particularly in the nose, but without grace notes or much resonance. Carbon tones dominate, but allow some sweetness and pungency to balance the cup.",Medium-Dark,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/major-dickasons-blend/,Major Dickason’s Blend,84,"The body is full, the taste richly pungent. The carbon tones permeate, having definitively chased the acidity south, but they're rich, complex carbon tones, rather than the thin kind that whine at you from the cup.",Dark,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/colombian-blend/,Colombian Blend,85,"This coffee is so complex at the top that it positively levitates, alive with sweet, light vanilla tones. In the finish whatever is left of the body vanishes, the vanilla tones fade, but the sweetness lingers.",Medium-Dark,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/house-blend-2/,House Blend,84,"The acidity doesn't immediately reveal itself in the deep, mouth-filling richness of this coffee, emerging most clearly in the powerful finish. A coffee that, in its understated complexity, seems considerably greater than its parts.",Medium,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/roaster-boy-blues/,Roaster Boy Blues,83,"This classic medium-dark coffee gives us solid, mouth-filling dark-roast pungency, though the carbon notes seem to co-opt its sweetness. Some acidity survives the roast, and fills out the top of the profile nicely.",Medium-Dark,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/house-blend/,House Blend,81,"The rest of the taste profile plays peek-a-boo around dominating carbon tones in this very dark roasted coffee. Nevertheless, the pungent sweetness that constitutes the upside of darker roasts prevails, particularly in the cup.",Dark,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/beanery-blend/,Beanery Blend,83,"A light-medium-roasted blend with power: The aroma is intense and classically acidy. For a coffee so lightly roasted the body is full, and the acidity teases and shimmers before emerging clearly in the finish.",Medium-Light,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/presidents-private-blend/,President’s Private Blend,75,"Given the medium roast, the carbon notes here are a bit of a surprise. Fortunately, the pungent sweetness also characteristic of darker roasts gives the burned, carbon notes some support, and the acidity holds its own until the finish, when it fades into the carbon.",Medium,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/traditional-roast/,Traditional Roast,74,"For such a relatively light roast, not particularly acidy. In fact, once past the classically rich, fragrant nose, rather flat. Perhaps the coffee arrived a bit stale. Full-bodied enough to please those who like to ride the classic American roast profile while relegating acidity to the back seat.",Light,Feb-97
https://www.coffeereview.com/review/special-roast/,Special Roast,68,"This coffee arrived pre-ground (not available whole bean), perhaps accounting for its flatness in nose and cup, although some herbal or prune notes survive in the thin, carbon-toned acidity.",Medium-Dark,Feb-97
